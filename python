# Python

These are a list of python features you MUST know
* print(string): prints a string to stdout
* x = value: Assigns a value to a variable
	* Note no declaration required
	* x = 1; x= "string" is valid python since variables are dynamically typed
		* Dynamic typing means the type of a variable may change during the exceution of a program
* [1, 2, 3]: Python lists (arrays)
	* Lists are heterogenous, i.e. they can have elements of different types, such as [1, "two", 0x3]
* for element in set: The python for loop is deisgned to iterate over a set of elements
	* these sets are often lists
	* to iterate over numbers, use range(start, end, step)
		* range(x) == range(0,x,1) and range(x,y) == range(x,y,1)
* input(<message>): Prints a message to stdout and then retreives an input frmo stdin
	* Usually use like so: x = input("message"), with command line as stdin
